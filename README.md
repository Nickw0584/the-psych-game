This project is a basic guessing game that allows you to compete againist
the computer. You guess a letter and see if it matches what the computer 
has guessed. If you are it tells you, you are right and adds to the wins
column. If you lose it marks a loses in the lose column. It shows the how
many guess you have taken also.

The project is useful in showing the basic skills in javascript.

Getting started is probally easiest if you think about the logic of the 
the problem and then go from there.
